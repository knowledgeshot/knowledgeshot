  "Title": "GameMaker Studio",
  "text": "GameMaker Studio is a cross-platform (primarily) 2D game engine, written in C++, created by Mark Overmars and further developed by the YoYo Games company. It is a very widely used and well-known engine thanks to it's simplicity; GameMaker Studio features an IDE where game developers can easily customise the elements inside of their game. GameMaker Studio defines two ways of programming games; it contains a drag and drog editor for those that are brand new to programming however it is severely limited with what it can create; the more sophisticated option is using GameMaker Studio's own scripting language which is unintuitively called GameMaker Language. This scripting language is fairly syntactically similar to C-like languages however it is dynamically typed making it feel more similar to languages such as JavaScript (little bit of a yikes, but great for indie devs who want to deploy an idea quickly with little hassle).",
